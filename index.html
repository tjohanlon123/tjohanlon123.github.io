		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I am a small town boy from Pendleton, Oregon. Growing up, I was always fascinated with how things worked and the physical principles that drived them. This was especially true when it came to objects in space. My fascination drove me to study physics and astrophysics at UC Berkeley. At UC Berkeley, I loved exploring the new things and experinces that the Bay Area had to offer. From camping and backpacking around California to playing on the Berkeley Quidditch team, I truly enjoyed my time at Berkeley. I even developed professionaly by working as a researcher at Space Science Lab. Berkeley taught me so much and I am exited for what the future holds!</p>

		<h2>Pendleton High School</h2>
			<p> I went to Pendleton High School where I graduated top of my class. While in school, I participated in choir, robotics, speach and debate, soccer, swimming, ASTRA, National honors society and many other activities.</p>

		<h1>Work Experience</h1>
		
			<h2>Research Intern</h2>
				<p><strong>Space Science Laboratory; Berkeley, California; January 2018 – Present</strong></p>

				<p> I currently work  at Space Science Laboratory supporting analysis and research for the Keck Planet Finder precision radial velocity spectrograph. Much of this work has been related to performance studies of multi-mode optical fibers. I have also worked with IR detection systems for the Infrared Spatial Interferometer group. </p>
			
			<h2>File Clerk</h2>
				<p><strong>Mautz and O’Hanlon; Pendleton, Oregon; June 2016 – August 2017</strong></p>
				<p> 
				I worked at a law office filing paperwork, processing discovery, and analyzing and distilling documents for future use. I worked independently and insured that the law firm’s daily paperwork was properly processed.</p>

	<div id="volunteer">
		<h1>Volunteer Experience</h1>
			<h2>Pendleton Round Up</h2>
				<p> The Pendleton Round-Up is the one of largest rodeos in the world and it is run by volunteers. I have been a volunteer for 5 years. As a volunteer, I was in charge of running the electronic eye. A key piece of equipment that makes sure the calves and steers are a set distance away from the ropers to ensure a equal and level playing field for all competitors. I have also worked for the parade department to help restore antique wagons and buggies to make sure they are in good working order for the annual "Westward Ho!" parade that accompanies the rodeo each year.</p>

		<h1>Programming</h1>

		<p>Having grown up with computers my whole life, I have always been comfortable using them. Throughout middle school and high school, I learned how to use Microsoft Word, Excel, and Powerpoint and have continued to develope these skills in college. I also got introduced to CAD software and basic programming and gained some practice with it in high school robotics club.

			<br>
			<br>

		My freshman year of college, I took my first course on Python and scientific programming. My sophomore year, I further developed my programming classes and through this developement, I was able to gain my research position at Space Science Lab. Through a combination of work as a research intern and my coursework, I have been programming in python for over 4 years. 

			<br>
			<br>

		Using python, I have developed programs for image and signal processing, wrote GUIs to control motors and operating CCD camera, made programs utilizing bayesian statistics, machine learning, and regression. I am familiar with many packages in Python such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, astropy, george, pymc3, sklearn and more.

			<br>
			<br>

		Beyond just python, I have developed skills in other programming languages as well. In my Data structures course, we learned and used Java throughout the course as well as Git and how to use Github. In my coursework, we would often have to do lab write ups and papers in LaTeX. At Space Science Lab, I learned how to use IDL, Labview and basic unix and linux. I have also learned C++, SQL, and HTML and CSS throughout my time at Berkeley.
